Official soundtrack by NeonInsect released at last! Note that the app size went up a fair bit for that reason (9ish mb to 61mb)

The way our Android build is prepared also changed a bit, could be unexpected issues, especially on older devices.

Other changes
- Star gates should no longer spawn within each other
- Ship icon should be visible while jumping between gates
- Equipped weapons should persist through reloads
- Lots of technical refactoring for later improvements
- Credits updated
