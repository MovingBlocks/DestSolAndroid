Patch release v1.4.1 with some recent fixes related to v1.4.0 and in general :-) 

- Mercenaries now start with an appropriate weapon so they'll be helpful without an awkward weapon item throwing phase. Huzzah! 
- Crash from trying to load a ship with too many items in the save (should be OK to load broken old saves with) 
- Allow volume control for both sfx and the new music separately 
- Optimization for how the new music is loaded 
- Minor extras like docs and project logistics
