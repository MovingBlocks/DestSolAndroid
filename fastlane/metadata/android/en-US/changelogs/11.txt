Our v2.0.0 release is finally here!

There have been many other small changes and as such it's just impossible to list them all.
Here are the highlights:
 - Significant code cleanups and enhancements
 - Many, many bug fixes (and probably just as many bug introductions!)
 - Brand new logo and animated menu background
 - Some UI tweaks, including a remade new ship screen in which you can select how many systems will be generated (up to 9!)
 - Some balance adjustments, including reducing the time between shots on the blaster
 - Continuing a game will now generate the very same world each time
 - Waypoints! Select anywhere on the map to mark for later.
 - You can now pan the map with your finger
 - Faction enhancements. Increase your reputation among factions by buying things from them, or shoot at them to make them dislike you!

Changes to system requirements:
 - The game now requires a minimum of Android 7.0 (Nougat) to run.
